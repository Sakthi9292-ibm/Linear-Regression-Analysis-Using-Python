# Simple Linear Regression 

Simple linear regression analysis deals with the single dependent and single independent variable following the below equation 

  y = ax +b 
  
  a = co-efficient of x 
  b = y intercept (error correction) 
  
  value of a and b can be calculated as 
       
                      (∑y)(∑X^2) – (∑(x)∑(xy))
        a =          ____________________
                       N(∑(x^2)) – (∑(x)^2)
